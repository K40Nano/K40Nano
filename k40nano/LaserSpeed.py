    This is the standard library for converting to and from speed code information for LHYMICRO-GL.

    The units in the speed code have particular bands/gears which slightly modifies the equations used
    to convert between values and speeds. The fundamental units within the speed code values are period-ticks.
    All values relate to a value in the counter to count off the number of oscillations within the
    (typically 22.1184) Mhz crystal. The max value here is 65535, potentially with the addition of a diagonal delay.

    For the M2 board, the original Chinese Software gave a slope of 12120. However experiments with the actual
    physical speed put this value at 17280. 22118400 hz / 17280 = 1280.

    The board is ultimately controlling a stepper motor and the speed a stepper motor travels is the result of
    the time between the ticks. Since the crystal oscillator is the same, the delay is controlled by the counted
    oscillations subticks, which gives us the time between stepper motor pulses. Most of the devices we are
    dealing with are 1000 dpi stepper motors, so, for example, to travel at 1 inch a second requires that the
    device tick at 1 kHz. To do this it must delay 1 ms between ticks. This corresponds to a value of 43136 in
    the M2 board. Which has an equation of 65536 - (5120 + 17280T) where T is the period requested in ms. This is
    equal to 25.4 mm/s. If we want a 2 ms delay, which is half the speed (0.5kHz, 0.5 inches/second, 12.7 mm/s)
    we do 65536 - (5120 + 34560) which gives us a value of 25856. This would be encoded as a 16 bit number
    broken up into 2 ascii 3 digit strings between 0-255. 101 for the high bits and 00 for the low bits.
    So CV01010001 where the final character "1" is the gearing equation we used.

    The speed in mm/s is also used for determining which gearing to use and as a factor for the horizontal
    encoded value, for some boards (B2, M2). Slowing down the device down while traveling diagonal to make the
    diagonal and orthogonal take the same amount of time (thereby cutting to the same depth). This is the same
    period-ticks units and is simply summed with the 65535 - (b + mT) value in cases that both stepper motors
    are used.

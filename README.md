# K40NanoDriver
Decoupled and extended low level support for K40, derived from K40 Whisperer.

K40NanoDriver is intended to pull out the low level support from K40Whisperer ( https://github.com/jkramarz/K40-Whisperer (not the author's github, there isn't an author's github)) and give it helpful and proper encapsolation and a functional low level API.
